Nsxtea is a small CLI to interact with the VMware NSX-T Policy Search API.

## Installation
Assuming you have already [installed go](https://golang.org/doc/install):

```sh
go get github.com/uempfel/nsxtea
go install github.com/uempfel/nsxtea
```

If you're getting  a `command not found` error, you might have to add your "go binary" directory to your PATH. To do so, run:
```sh 
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
